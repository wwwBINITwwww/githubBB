                <p>Hi, I am Binit Shilpakar. I am a student, a new pupil to the field of vast technology. 
                Experienced with small first hand projects relating to web-development 
                and with a science background including both physics and chemistry.  I enjoy creating intuitive user experiences using domain knowledge.</p>

                <p>I am excited to embark on a journey of creativity, innovation, and problem-solving in the digital realm. 
                With a passion for technology and a drive to make a positive impact,
                I am committed to mastering the art and science of coding to craft elegant and efficient solutions to real-world challenges.
                Armed with a strong foundation in computer science principles and a thirst for knowledge,
                I am ready to dive into the dynamic and ever-evolving field of software development.</p>

                <p>As I navigate the complexities of software development, 
                I am guided by a commitment to continuous learning and growth.
                I embrace challenges as opportunities for personal and professional development, 
                and I am not afraid to push the boundaries of what is possible. 
                With a combination of technical expertise, creative thinking, and a collaborative spirit, 
                I am confident in my ability to thrive in the fast-paced and ever-changing world of software development.
                </p>

                <p>When I am not designing, 
                I love traveling, photography, VR gaming, pc gaming, mobile gaming and sleeping.
